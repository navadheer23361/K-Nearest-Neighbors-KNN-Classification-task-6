# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification-task-6

This task implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using Scikit-learn. It includes feature normalization, label encoding, evaluation across multiple values of K, and visualization of decision boundaries using PCA. The model is assessed using accuracy and confusion matrices, with graphical insights provided via matplotlib and seaborn
